Usage
=====

Create and activate a new virtual environment:

    python3 -m venv venv
    . ./venv/bin/activate

Install necesary dependencies:

	pip install -r requirements.txt

Modify conf.py as needed:

	vi conf.py

Run simulation:

	python3 model.py

An overall progress bar is shown during the simulation, and more detailed
results are stored in a log file. Logs and charts are stored in ./out/. The
simulation will be skipped if a file named simulation.pkl is present. It will be
loaded and used instead of the simulation being run.
